List select groups and their members on a new `/groups` page of the forum.

A permission controls who can see the page.

Settings are available to configure which groups to show, a description to show below the group (formatting enabled).
You can also automatically add a link in the sidebar, as well as show or hide additional badges and online status on the groups page.

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-group-list

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
